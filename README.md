### This repo allows you play a mutliplayer Tic-tac-toe game

#### To run the code:
1. `cd backend` and run `npm install`. To start the server, type `npm start`
2. `cd frontend` and run `npm install`. To start a client, type `npm start`
3.  Once the server and client are running successfully, open `localhost:3000` from your browser window. This establishes a client connection.
4. Open another browser with the same `localhost:3000` URL to setup a second client. Once two clients are connected, the game can be played.
